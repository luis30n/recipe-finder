As a RecipeFinder user, I want to search for recipes with the ingredients that I have at home

## Acceptance Criteria
- When a RecipeFinder user accesses the [homepage of the RecipeFinder web](https://recipe-find3r.fly.dev/), there will be an input element where the user can search for recipes.
- When a user adds ingredients to the input and searches (either pressing Enter on his keyboard or pressing the Search button), recipes are filtered by ingredients.
- A recipe will be included in the results if any of the ingredients entered by the user is used in the recipe.
